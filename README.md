# Pizza Order Using Object-Oriented JavaScript

## Created by Lara Bjork on November 8, 2019

### Project Description
This project was completed as an independent project at Epicodus, for the first week of the Intermediate JavaScript class. The task description was as follows:

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.

Code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Code meets standards from previous weeks.
* Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
* Application works as expected.
* Plain English specs are included in your README.
* Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

### Project Specifications
I developed the following specifications for this project:

1. The program will be able to collect input from the user regarding pizza size.
Input: Radio button or drop down menu for size
Output: Selection reported back to user/available for price calculation

2. The program will be able to collect input from the user regarding pizza toppings.
Input: Checkboxes for toppings
Output: Selection reported back to user/available for price calculation

3. The program will be able to calculate the price based on size and toppings
Input: List of selections made by the user
Output: Total price of pizza order


### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, JavaScript, and jQuery v3.4.1 (uncompressed development version).
Project was written using Google Chrome; no other browsers were tested for compatibility.

### Project Setup instructions
There shouldn't be any special setup required. If something doesn't display correctly or goes wrong somehow, please contact me at <lara.m.bjork@gmail.com> and I will do my best to troubleshoot for you.

### Known Issues
* KEEP THIS IF IT APPLIES: Although there is responsive sizing in place, this project is best viewed on standard desktop. It was not tested on a large desktop, table, or phone.
